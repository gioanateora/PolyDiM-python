**PolyDiM** (POLYtopal DIscretization Methods ) is a numerical computational library designed for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) using discretization methods that operate on generic polytopal (polygonal/polyhedral) meshes.

PolyDiM is inspired by and built upon the foundational research of the Numerical Analysis Group in the Department of Mathematical Sciences "Giuseppe Luigi Lagrange" (DISMA) at the Politecnico di Torino.
