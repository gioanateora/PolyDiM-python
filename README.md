**PolyDiM** (POLYtopal DIscretization Methods ) is a numerical computational library designed for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) using discretization methods that operate on generic polytopal (polygonal/polyhedral) meshes.

PolyDiM is fully integrated with **GeDiM** (GEometry for DIscretization MEthods), a C++ library developed by the same authors to provide robust geometry handling for
polytopal domains. 

PolyDiM&GeDiM is inspired by and built upon the foundational research of the Numerical Analysis Group in the Department of Mathematical Sciences "G. L. Lagrange" (DISMA) at the Politecnico di Torino.

Further features can be added to the library upon request.
